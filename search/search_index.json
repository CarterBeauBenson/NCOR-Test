NCOR draws on the expertise of ontologists associated with the University at Buffalo and of their collaborators in scientific, commercial and government institutions throughout the world.</p> <p>NCOR serves as a vehicle to coordinate, enhance, publicize, and seek funding for ontological research activities. It provides coordination, infrastructure, and independent review to organizations employing ontologies in fields such as defense and intelligence, management, healthcare and biomedical sciences.</p> <p>It provides researchers working in ontology-related areas with specialized support in seeking external funding and in assembling collaborative, interdisciplinary teams both nationally and internationally. It provides consultant services for ontology projects especially in the defense and security fields and in health care and biomedical informatics. NCOR also engages in training and outreach endeavors that are designed to broaden the range of institutions and individuals accepting the goals of high quality ontology in both theory and practice.</p> <p>Contemporary ontology is a partnership of multiple disciplines. On the one hand ontological research involves philosophers who are concerned to describe broad categories of entities and their most basic relationships. On the other hand ontologists are working in diverse fields of computer and information science to provide more narrowly focused classification systems in areas such as bioinformatics, engineering, or defense and security.</p> <p>Ontologists have identified a wide range of theories and methods to aid the consistent representation of data and information using classifications of this sort, called \u2018ontologies\u2019. The idea, in all these cases, is that when bodies of data are annotated using well-structured ontologies, these data can be more easily retrieved, integrated and compared, and they can more easily be exploited for purposes of computer-based reasoning.</p> <p>In biology and biomedicine, especially, ontologists have developed controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology that are being used to describe the results of biological experiments in a consistent fashion that allows comparison of data pertaining to multiple species, diseases and biological systems. In government, administration and commerce ontologies are being used, similarly, to connect data across different departments (such as large government agencies) and to make these data accessible to standard software tools.</p> <p>Ontologists study how definitions, classifications and relationships should be formulated using the tools of logic and formal semantics in order to most effectively achieve these goals. Their research provides foundations for diverse technologies in areas such as information integration, natural language processing, data annotation, and the construction of intelligent computer systems. Ontologies can also be used by human beings to codify and make explicit common understandings that support human-to-human communication and successful collaborative research across disciplinary boundaries.</p>"},{"location":"associate/","title":"Associate","text":""},{"location":"bootcamps/","title":"Basic Formal Ontology ISO/IEC 21838:2 Specialist","text":"<p>Participants will gain facility with applying BFO classes and relations to a range of practical modeling problems while maintaining conformance to the top-level ontology 21838:2 specification.

The group has in particular focused on a mapping between BFO and the W3C standard Provenance Ontology (PROV-O), as well as a mapping between the Common Core Ontologies suit and PROV-O.</p> <p>The SMWG is chaired by Tim Prudhomme. Meetings regularly involve discussion of challenges associated with semantic mappings, both conceptual and technical. Please see the minutes from past meetings below for a better understanding of topics covered. Meetings are held weekly.</p> <p>If you would like to attend SMWG meetings either in-person or remotely, contact Giacomo De Colle at: gdecolle[@]buffalo.edu.</p> Minutes Semantic Mapping Resources <p>Genuine, robust, semantic mappings across ontologies are challenging to create and there are numerous resources the group has leveraged to make progress:</p> <ul> <li>BFO Mappings Github Repository</li> <li>BFO-PROV Mapping Github Repository</li> <li>W3C PROV-O Documentation.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"specialists/","title":"Specialist","text":""},{"location":"training/","title":"Overview","text":"NCOR Certificate Pathways NCOR Certificate Pathways Foundational Certificates <p>Explore foundational ontology engineering concepts, technologies, and the semantic web stack that can facilitate their development.</p> \u25be Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) Practitioner <p>Learn the basics of BFO classes and relations, applications, and design patterns.</p> Overview <p>The BFO Practitioner Certificate introduces students to the fundamentals of modeling data with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), a top-level architecture used by over 500 ontology and knowledge graph projects across the world. Students gain hands-on modeling experiences, working with subject-matter experts on active open-source projects leveraging BFO. Additionally, students will learn the philosophical and practical motivations for the distinctions drawn in BFO. This certificate course covers necessary building blocks for mastering differences and similarities across alternative top-level ontology architectures as well as for leveraging open-source ontologies to model specific domains, such as biomedicine, cyber security, climate change, and immigration, among many others.
